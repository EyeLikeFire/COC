            <span id="steveMillerCt" class="staffCt">After graduating from Valparaiso University with a B.S. in elementary education in 1991, Steve Miller taught 3rd and 4th grades at COS for ten years, marrying Pastor Nick's daughter Cathy along the way. In 2001, the Millers and their two boys moved to China to teach English in Guizhou Normal University for ten years. On their furlough year in 2006-2007, Steve returned with his family, including two blond China-born daughters, to COS to teach 5th and 6th grades and P.E. After ten years total in China, the Millers again have been unable to resist the call of COS. Steve likes to play and watch all kinds of sports, go fishing and bow hunting, play guitar and mandolin, run, and write. His artistic outlet is decorating birthday cakes to look like anything his children, relatives, or esteemed friends desire.</span>

            <span id="phyllisButlerCt" class="staffCt">After twenty years of staying home with her family, she decided to go back to college and realized her ambition of becoming a teacher. She enrolled at Jefferson College and re-discovered the joys of algebra at age forty! She knew she did not want to major in math. After getting her associate's degree, she made arrangements to finish at Fontbonne College in St. Louis. Her major was in communication art/theater education with a minor in English. She graduated with honors and thought, "Now what?" Her plan was to teach drama in her hometown (De Soto). She substitute taught for a year, and it became apparent to her that teaching at DeSoto Public School was not God's plan. He led her (and her children) to Christian Outreach School. As always, He knew what was best. All three of her children are successful adults now&mdash;who continue to walk with Christ&mdash;after graduation from COS, and her family (herself especially) have been richly blessed. Praise the Lord! Now her grandchildren attend COS and comes to school with her every morning.</span>

He is interested in family, grandkids, missions, politics, classical music, history, and fixing things so they work properly. He has been active in Christian Outreach Church since 1977, and has been teaching Christian Instruction at Christian Outreach School since 2001. With the inception of a more classical approach to education at COS, he began teaching Modern Greek and Introductory Logic. “Why do I teach at COS?”, he asks. "I want our students to excel under the tutelage of the Holy Spirit in this God-mocking society we live in today, just like Daniel and his companions excelled in their day."</span>

            <span id="janeLorenzCt" class="staffCt">When Jane was four years old, her family moved to the Goldman, MO area so that her father could attend COSM. She attended CODS, as it was called at that time, from kindergarten until she graduated with the class of '91. Afterward, she attended Jefferson College, pursuing a degree in Hotel and Restaurant Management. Jefferson County and Christian Outreach has always been her home, and now her husband, Daniel, and she are bringing up her family here as well. After homeschooling for three years, they are thrilled to be able to send their two boys to COS. Jane has been learning sign language in order to communicate with her daughter who is deaf as a result of contracting meningitis as an infant. There was an obvious need for their sons to learn sign language as well, and since students were interested in a class, Jane began teaching Introduction to Sign Language at COS for the 2012-2013 school year. The following year, Jane accepted the challenge of teaching 1st-3rd grade and Intermediate Sign Language. After more than fifteen years of working in hotels or food service, she finds herself teaching at COS (a childhood dream of hers) and once again feeling a part of the COS family.</span>
