                What We Believe

                God commands us to love our brothers and sisters in Christ. The unity of the Church does not depend on theological formulations, but on a living relationship with the Lord Jesus. If you belong to Him, you are our brother or sister and we can rejoice in our fellowship!
                While some of our beliefs are not up for discussion, other matters are not so fundamental to the Christian faith, and should be discussed in love, avoiding unnecessary division. That said, here is our statement of faith:
                
                </p>
                <details class="font-dark">

                    <ul id="beliefs" class="shadow-background">
                        <li>
                        We believe that God is the infinite, eternal Creator of the universe Who has revealed Himself as One God yet as three Persons: the Father, the Son, and the Holy Spirit. Through the Son and by the power of the Spirit the Father created the entire seen and unseen creation, including man, in six days.  
                        </li>
                        <hr/>
                        <li>
                        According to their eternal plan, the Father sent the Son into the World, to be born of a woman, born under the Law, to redeem us who were under the Law. By His sinless, obedient life, death, resurrection, and ascension, the Son has freed us from the guilt and power of sin. He has made full payment for all transgressions, and has overcome sin, death, and hell. He has opened to us free access to the Father, purchased our healing, and redeemed us from all bondage through His cross.
                        </li>
                        <hr/>
                        <li>
                        Christ will come again in power and glory, to judge the living and the dead. Those who believed in Him shall be granted eternal life with Him, while those who rejected Him shall be sent to an eternal hell of punishment and torment.
                        </li>
                        <hr/>
                        <li>
                        As glorious Victor over principalities and powers He shares the spoils of His victory with His Church. He sends gifts of men: apostles, prophets, evangelists, pastors and teachers to equip the saints to serve. After His ascension to the right hand of the Father, He received the promised Holy Spirit and poured Him out upon all flesh.
                        </li>
                        <hr/>
                        <li>
                        The Holy Spirit calls and gathers the Church through the Gospel, which Gospel He desires to confirm in signs and wonders. The Spirit was poured out so that all believers would receive power to witness in word and deed. The Spirit equips the Church for sanctification, worship, and ministry worldwide.
                        </li>
                        <hr/>
                        <li>
                        By the Holy Spirit, God has given us the Holy Scriptures. They are God-breathed, inerrant, and are the final and only rule of the Church's faith, practice, and life.

                  <p class="font-dark">
                      Christian Outreach Church began, not so much as a church congregation, but as a place where various ministries would be able to work side by side. Initially, three leaders came together with the same need: a place to house their ministries. Bob Heil, an ex-Lutheran pastor, longed for a school to train leaders and send them out. Linn Haitz, a long-time missionary, wanted to house a missions organization and train missionaries. Ron Sutton, a youth pastor, sought a refuge center for the outcast and drug addicts from St. Louis. In 1974, through many hours of discussion, prayer and searching, the three located and obtained the land that is now Christian Outreach Center.
                      The congregation was a natural outgrowth of those ministries—and others throughout the years—working in close proximity.
